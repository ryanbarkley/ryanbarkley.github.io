While it is impossible to eliminate 100% of risk, there are a few (relatively) simple things you can do to reduce your risk in a meaningful way and help limit the blast radius if your password is compromised.</p><h2 id=starting-with-your-personal-threat-model>Starting with your personal threat model</h2><p>Before you can decide what steps you should take to help secure your digital life, it can be helpful to think through what you consider to be your personal digital <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model>threat model</a>. For context, here are just a <em>few</em> of the many ways you can be compromised in our modern digital world:</p><ul><li>‚ö†Ô∏è Data breaches</li><li>‚ö†Ô∏è Outdated or unmaintained software</li><li>‚ö†Ô∏è Trojans or untrustworthy software</li><li>‚ö†Ô∏è Phishing or other social engineering attacks</li></ul><p>I want to emphasize that there are <em>many</em> other ways you can be compromised and this is not at all an exhaustive list. It is, however, the basis of what I&rsquo;ll be attempting to address in this article for practicality.</p><h2 id=covering-a-few-basics>Covering a few basics</h2><h3 id=-use-strong-passwords-or-passphrases-and-avoid-reuse-across-systems>‚úÖ Use strong passwords (or passphrases!) and avoid reuse across systems.</h3><p>Using a password manager makes this a lot easier. Personally, I use <a href=https://keepass.info/>KeePass</a> for an offline password manager for most things and Chrome&rsquo;s built-in password manager for things I&rsquo;m less concerned about. Online services such as <a href=https://www.lastpass.com/>LastPass</a> and <a href=https://1password.com/>1Password</a> are popular options as well. Keep in mind that each solution has its own security tradeoffs and consider what best suits your risk tolerance and threat model.</p><h3 id=-enable-multi-factor-authentication-mfa>‚úÖ Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</h3><p>The first factor of authentication is usually a password. By adding a second &ldquo;something you have&rdquo; factor, you can help reduce the risk of your account being breached in the event your password is compromised. This is often implemented by adding your phone number to your account and then sending you a one-time verification code via SMS that you enter in addition to your password when you log in. However, due to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam>security concerns</a> it is generally preferred to use an authenticator app or hardware key instead when supported. Personally, I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">Google Authenticator</a> for an app and prefer to use a <a href=https://www.yubico.com/>YubiKey</a> whenever a service supports it.</p><h3 id=-keep-your-software-up-to-date>‚úÖ Keep your software up-to-date.</h3><p>After a 0-day is released, it will hopefully be patched quickly by the relevant vendors, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter if you never install the security patch. Consider enabling automatic updates for anything that supports it. If you use Windows, consider checking the option to update other Microsoft software when Windows updates are installed.</p><h3 id=-review-third-party-apps--recent-account-access>üëÄ Review third-party apps & recent account access.</h3><p>Your username and password may be the front door to your account, but don&rsquo;t forget about the back and side entrances. Over the years, you&rsquo;ve probably installed or authorized numerous third-party applications to access your accounts. Some of these types of applications are legit and useful, but others aren&rsquo;t. Take a few minutes to review what services have access to your accounts. For most services, you can find this somewhere on the Account/Settings/Security pages.</p><p>While you&rsquo;re reviewing applications authorized for each service, consider reviewing recent account access for suspicious activity if supported. Even if you don&rsquo;t have reason to believe you&rsquo;ve been compromised, it&rsquo;s a good idea to review your account access to ensure things look legit. If supported, consider logging out of any devices you no longer use.</p><h3 id=-review-browser-extensions>üëÄ Review browser extensions.</h3><p>Browser extensions frequently have a <em>high</em> level of access to every site you visit so consider disabling or removing any you don&rsquo;t need and ensure the ones you keep are legit.</p><h3 id=-scrutinize-links-to-login-forms>üëÄ Scrutinize links to login forms.</h3><p>Instead of clicking links in emails or articles that prompt you to log into your account, consider navigating to the site directly. (Another advantage of using a password manager is that some will autofill your credentials based on the site&rsquo;s URL, helping to avoid entering credentials into fake/spoofed login forms.)</p><h2 id=additional-resources>Additional Resources</h2><ul><li>Google offers a <a href=https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup>security checkup tool</a> to go through their recommended security checkup workflow as well as an <a href=https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/>Advanced Protection Program</a> to enable additional layers of protection for your account.</li><li>Facebook offers a <a href=https://www.facebook.com/help/securitycheckup>security checkup tool</a> to go through their recommended security checkup workflow.</li><li><a href=https://haveibeenpwned.com/>Have I Been Pwned</a> offers a free service to see if your account has been compromised in a past data breach as well as the option to notify you via email if your account is compromised in a future breach.</li><li><a href=https://decentsecurity.com/>Decent Security</a> has several great articles, including ones focused on networking and Windows-specific concerns.</li></ul></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/software-quality/ class="right arrow">&#8594;</a>
